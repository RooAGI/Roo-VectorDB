    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to perform long-document search using Roo-VectorDB. As an example, we treat books as long documents, and show how to run searches at different levels of granularity—such as chapters, sections, paragraphs, or the entire book.\n",
    "We use the [Pile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/pile) dataset (specifically the *Books1* subset) as the source of data. This subset contains approximately 18,000 books, each ranging from 100,000 to 1,000,000 words. For this tutorial, we randomly sample 1,000 books from the dataset.\n",
    "Because a single book is too large to store as one record—making both storage and search inefficient—we preprocess the books using [LangChain TextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/). Each book is split into 1024‑token chunks with a 30% overlap between adjacent chunks. Each chunk is stored as an individual row in the database table. The preprocessed dataset can be downloaded here:\n",
